## Hello there...

A predominantly self-taught software engineer seeking a constructive working environment to support myself and my exploration of complexity and effective leadership. I have 10+ years of general software development experience including 6 years across two universities and 4 years in industry.

My wider career purpose, within the software domain, is to combine minimalism, empiricism, and agile thinking to remove redundant product and project complexity, accelerate development, and effectively capitalise on individual and team potential through alternative leadership and the cultivation of supportive environments.

I would describe myself as strong willed and intrinsically motivated with an affection for experimentation and counterintuitive ideas. My primary selling points are my conscientiousness, ability to master new skills quickly, and my shameless questioning of practices and ideas, including my own.
