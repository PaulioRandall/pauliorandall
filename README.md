## Hello there...

I'm a predominantly self-taught software engineer seeking a constructive working environment to support myself and my exploration of programming, science, betterment, and effective leadership. I have 10+ years of general software development experience including 6 years across two universities and 4 years in industry.

My wider career purpose is to combine minimalism, empiricism, and agile thinking to:
- Grow software that makes an impact;
- Continuously optimise working practices to reduce waste and accelerate development;
- Incorporate behavioral science, statistics, and scientific thinking into everyday software development.

I'm a generalist and skeptic to the core, I focus on mastering new skills quickly and shamelessly questioning everything. I'd describe myself as intrinsically motivated, conscientiousness, fast working, and affectionate towards experimentation and counterintuitive ideas.
