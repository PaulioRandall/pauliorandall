# And so it begins...

_"The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane"_ - Marcus Aurelius

My values were born from haste, minimalism, empiricism, and skepticism. I'm also highly affectionate towards experimentation and counterintuitive ideas. I've amassed many ideas that go against popular opinion, or in other words, my experience has taught me that _"there is no wisdom in crowds"_.

What do I want to bring to the table?

- processes optimised by outcomes
- speed: build fast, fix faster
- the behavioral sciences
- visualisations of everything
