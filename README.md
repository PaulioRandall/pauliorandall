## Hello there...

*"Trust no one, especially yourself!"*

My values were born from haste, minimilism, empiricism, and skepticism. I'm also highly affectionate towards experimentation and counterintuitive ideas. I've amassed many ideas that go aginst popular opinion, or in otherwords, my experience has taught me that *"there is no wisdom in crowds"*.

What do I want to bring to the table:

- processes optimised by outcomes
- speed: build things fast, very fast, and then fix the mistakes quickly
- the behavioral sciences
- naked statistics
- visualisations of everything
