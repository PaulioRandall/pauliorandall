## Hello there...

I'm a predominantly self-taught software engineer with a wider career purpose to combine minimalism, empiricism, and agile thinking to:
- Grow services and systems that actually deliver value;
- Continuously optimise working practices to reduce waste and accelerate development;
- Incorporate behavioral science, statistics, and skeptic thinking to improve design and decision making.

I'd describe myself as:
- Intrinsically motivated;
- Conscientiousness;
- Fast, interative, and incremental worker;
- Highly affectionate towards experimentation and counterintuitive ideas.
