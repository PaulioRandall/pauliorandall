## Hello there...

_"Trust no one, especially yourself!"_

My values were born from haste, minimalism, empiricism, and skepticism. I'm also highly affectionate towards experimentation and counterintuitive ideas. I've amassed many ideas that go against popular opinion, or in other words, my experience has taught me that _"there is little wisdom in crowds"_.

What do I want to bring to the table?

- processes optimised by outcomes
- speed: build fast, fix faster
- the behavioral sciences
- naked statistics
- visualisations of everything
