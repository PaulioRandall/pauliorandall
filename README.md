## Hello there...

Im a predominantly self-taught programmer and software engineer currently seeking a constructive working environment to support myself and my exploration of complexity and effective leadership. My primary selling point is my abstract and objective view points and, while I have personal preferences, I have a propensity to let the voice of the under dog be heard.

My wider career purpose is to combine minimalism, empiricism, and agile thinking to remove redundant complexity, accelerate development, and effectively capitalise on individual and team potential through alternative leadership and the cultivation of supportive environments.

I have 10+ years of systems development experience including 6 years across two universities and 4 years in industry. I would describe myself as strong willed and intrinsically motivated with an affection for experimentation and counterintuitive ideas.
