# Lean Digital Data Services Specialist

> _"To survive you must adapt faster than your surroundings can change"_ - Jack Matson | _'Innovate or Die'_

I specialise in the cultivation of humble and adaptive digital data services by virtue of an empirical mindset and lean means:

- Research
- Design
- Analytics
- Engineering
- Leadership

You'll find many of my techniques counterintuitive, but I don't do what makes sense in terms of common prevailing beliefs. I focus on finding what genuinely generates positive and sustainable outcomes.
